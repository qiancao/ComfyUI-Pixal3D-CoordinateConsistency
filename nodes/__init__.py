"""ComfyUI-Pixal3D nodes — aggregated NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS for register_nodes()."""

# Note: pixal3d code now imports the installed wheel names directly --
# `cumesh_vb`, `o_voxel_vb_ap`, `flex_gemm_ap` (matching TRELLIS2's pattern).
# A previous sys.modules alias hack here aliased the bare names; that turned
# out to silently swallow ImportError and mask real failures, so it was
# removed and every call site was renamed to use the wheel names explicitly.
